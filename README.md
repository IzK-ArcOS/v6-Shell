# ArcOS Shell
The shell for the ArcOS project. Quite an essential thing, don't you think? Effective in ArcOS
versions 6.0.0 and above. This repository is a submodule of [ArcOS v6](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/v6).
It references APIs and code from the parent codebase to function, and will therefor not run outside of
ArcOS itself.


## Dependencies

v6 submodules depend on various assets and APIs from the parent v6 codebase. This specific submodule's dependencies can be found [here](./DEPS.md).
